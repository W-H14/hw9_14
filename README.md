Java enforces strict typing for variables.

For floating points, add 'f' at the end. Double and Float are different.

Java lacks an object datatype but uses object reference datatypes. Variables point to object memory locations.

Reference variables can share objects; primitives can't.

Primitives hold values; references point to objects.

Unreferenced objects in the garbage collection heap get cleaned up.

Arrays are objects.

State affects behavior, and vice versa.

Classes are blueprints for objects.

Constructors make object rules; "super()" calls the parent constructor.

Methods need matching arguments.

Methods return matching types.

Setters and getters tweak object properties.

Encapsulation restricts access using private and protected.

Comparing primitives checks values; references check memory locations
